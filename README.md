# events

A tiny event library used by [fruitmachine](https://github.com/ftlabs/fruitmachine). Fruitmachine is a lightweight component layout engine for client and server. As of March 2022 fruitmachine is in use in the [FT App](https://github.com/Financial-Times/ft-app) but has been partially replaced by Preact.

This project was forked from https://github.com/wilsonpage/evt for ease of maintenance.
